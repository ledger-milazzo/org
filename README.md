# LEDGER Milazzo project

[English]

Welcome to the LEDGER [Milazzo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milazzo) github organization.

### Introduction

This organization started with the workshop attended by the first 8 of 16 [LEDGER.eu](https://ledgerproject.eu/) projects on 28. October 2019.

On 31. October 2019 the attending LEDGER teams presented their findings in the [I.T.T.S Ettore Majorana](http://www.itimajorana.edu.it/index.php).

During the presentation we also invited people living in and around Milazzo to make use of our effort.

### Purpose

In this github organization you can find repositories that each contain an thoughts/concept/idea on how to improve Milazzo.
You can ask questions to each idea in each issue tracker. The initial team members can give guidance on how to continue on a given topic.

If one of the projects gains the support from the Milazzo community in the form of contributions, we welcome a "graduation" of the project. This means that the project will be transferred to a new organization where the contributors can use the given material to autonomously continue with the effort.

### Open Government

If you are from Milazzo we welcome you to join this group by creating an issue with [this link](https://github.com/ledger-milazzo/org/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=member-request.md&title=Ciao%21+Ledger+Milazzo).

This organization is governed by the members in the _"Consiglio"_ group. The job of this group is to resolve any conflicts and be able to help if some taks can not be done by a member. In order to be part of _"Consiglio"_ you need to be recommended by two other _Consiglio_ members.

All rules for the organization are all explained here, but this is a living document. If you think something should be changed or added, please [Edit](https://github.com/ledger-milazzo/org/edit/master/README.md) this document and send a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
